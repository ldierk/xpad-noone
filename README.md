# Updated Xpad Linux Kernel Driver
Driver for the Xbox/ Xbox 360/ Xbox 360 Wireless Controllers

This driver includes the latest changes in the upstream linux kernel and additionally carries the following staging changes:

* support for more compatible devices
* support for xbox360 class controllers, that need initialisation

## Xbox One Controllers
Xbox One Controller support has been removed to allow for compatibility with [xone](https://github.com/dlundqvist/xone).
The kernel module and DKMS package are now named xpad-noone. The USB driver also registers as xpad-noone, enabling clean coexistence with [xone](https://github.com/dlundqvist/xone). (Stock xpad can remain blacklisted by xone.)

**Connecting via Bluetooth**  
If you get past the pairing issues, the controller will operate in the [generic-HID bluetooth profile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Bluetooth_profiles#Human_Interface_Device_Profile_(HID)).  
The xpad driver will not be used.


# Installing
```
sudo modprobe -r xpad xpad-noone || true
sudo git clone https://github.com/forkymcforkface/xpad-noone.git /usr/src/xpad-noone-1.0
sudo dkms install -m xpad-noone -v 1.0
echo 'xpad-noone' | sudo tee /etc/modules-load.d/xpad-noone.conf
sudo modprobe xpad-noone
```
# Updating
```
cd /usr/src/xpad-noone-1.0
sudo git fetch
sudo git checkout origin/master
sudo dkms remove -m xpad-noone -v 1.0 --all
sudo dkms install -m xpad-noone -v 1.0
```
# Removing
```
sudo modprobe -r xpad-noone || true
sudo dkms remove -m xpad-noone -v 1.0 --all
sudo rm -rf /usr/src/xpad-noone-1.0
sudo rm -f /etc/modules-load.d/xpad-noone.conf
sudo modprobe xpad
```
# Usage
This driver creates three devices for each attached gamepad

1. /dev/input/js**N**
    * example `jstest /dev/input/js0`
2. /sys/class/leds/xpad**N**/brightness
    * example `echo COMMAND > /sys/class/leds/xpad0/brightness` where COMMAND is one of
        *  0: off
        *  1: all blink, then previous setting
        *  2: 1/top-left blink, then on
        *  3: 2/top-right blink, then on
        *  4: 3/bottom-left blink, then on
        *  5: 4/bottom-right blink, then on
        *  6: 1/top-left on
        *  7: 2/top-right on
        *  8: 3/bottom-left on
        *  9: 4/bottom-right on
        * 10: rotate
        * 11: blink, based on previous setting
        * 12: slow blink, based on previous setting
        * 13: rotate with two lights
        * 14: persistent slow all blink
        * 15: blink once, then previous setting
3. the generic event device
    * example `fftest /dev/input/by-id/usb-*360*event*`

# Debugging
As a regular unpriveledged user

Setup console to display kernel log.  
`dmesg --level=debug --follow`

Open a new console and access the device with jstest.  
`jstest /dev/input/jsX`

Interact with the device and observe that data packets recieved from device are printed to kernel log.
